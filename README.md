# project-blackjack

## Objective:
  - Create a browser-based game that allows allows two players to play the amazing BlackJack!

## To play the game:
- Click here to play the game.

## Motivation:
BlackJack is a card game of strategy and skills. There's an understated excitement to get a BlackJack! :) Mastering the coding of BlackJack will be a gate way for me to develop a popular (and now illegal game - yes it's that popular) in the Philippines called Tong Its.

## Developer Ahas:
Never have I thought that my favorite asino game would challenge beyond anything I have done in the past. As shown below my final product is far less than my original plan. I've learned 3 things doing this project: 1. Nothing is too ambitious enough, 2. Javascript is the fun! 3. Javascript possibilities are endless! In the end, I am very happy choosing my favorite game. I would rather fail trying knowing what I've capable of than settle for anything less than my abilities.

## Prototype View:
